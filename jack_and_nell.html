

Three years ago since Jack and Joe
Set sail across the foam
Each vowed a fortune he would gain
Before returning home
In just one year Jack gained his wealth
And started home that day
but when the pals shook hands to part
Poor Joe could only say

Give my love to Nellie, Jack
And kiss her once for me
The dearest girl in all this world
I'm sure you'll say is she
Treat her kindly Jack, old pal
Tell her I am well
His parting words were don't forget
Oh give my love to Nell.

Three years had passed when Joe at last
Had gained his wealth for life
He started home across the foam
To make sweet Nell his wife
At last poor Joe when he got there
Jack and Nell had wed
With sobs and threats he now regrets
That he had ever ever said.

Give my love to Nellie, Jack
And kiss her once for me
The dearest girl in all this world
I'm sure you'll say is she
Treat her kindly Jack, old pal
Tell her I am well
His parting words were don't forget
Oh give my love to Nell.

They chanced to meet upon the street
Joe said, you selfish "ELF"
The very next girl I learn to love
I'll kiss her for myself
But all is fair in love, they say
As you have gone and wed
I'll not be angry with you pal
And once again he said.

Give my love to Nellie, Jack
And kiss her once for me
The dearest girl in all this world
I'm sure you'll say is she
Treat her kindly Jack, old pal
Tell her I am well
His parting words were don't forget
Oh give my love to Nell.
