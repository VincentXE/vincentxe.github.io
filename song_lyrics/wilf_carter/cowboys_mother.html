Cowboy's Mother

<pre>A cowboy's mother lays dying
In the east of the close of the day
Like the sun in the west, she was sinking
To the journey so far far away

She gazed at a picture and whispered
By my side I wish you could be
My boy I will meet you in heaven
Forever we'll live happily

The day that you left me to wonder
The future for you seemed so bright
In a vision it seems I can see you
Your smile was much brighter tonight

The cowboy out west lay a dreaming
Of a home and a mother so dear
He dreamt that he heard her a calling
And he wipe from her sad face a tear

(Yodeling)

He fondle her clothes to his bosom
And he dreams that night as he lay
Next morning he read the sad message
That the angels took mother away

His friends told him the story
While his blue eyes well with a tear
He thought of his dream and he murmured
Her voice seemed to be oh so near

The old home is sad and so lonely
No sound of the old rocking chair
No more of that sweet voice to greet you
Theres nothing but emptyness there

Her soul has answered his calling
To come to the land far away
And enjoy the life everlastying
Waiting the great judgement day

(Yodeling)
