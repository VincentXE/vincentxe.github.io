Wilf Carter - Dad's Little Texas Lad

<pre>I'm just a texas cowboy
I have not got a home
I was raised out on the priare
Many deserts have I roamed

I was given a horse and saddle
And learned to ride the range
And punch those longhorn caddle
That can never be tamed

They say I had a sister
Who left when mother died
When I was just a little tot lying helpless by her side
I was raised by dear ol' daddy
They say he did his best
One day while trying to save me
The caddle tramped him to death

I'm going to tell this story
As it was told to me
By a lad called the texas ranger
Who saw that big stampede

In the latter part of August
In the year of 19'3
My dad took me a riding
Those longhorns for to see

While he was busy riding
And I was playing around
A longhorn got excited
Started pawing up the ground

The rest of them took the warning
And broke in wild stampede
They circled at the rio grand
And headed straight for me

The cowboys tried to head em'
Riding at full speed
Lashing with their lariots
And riding hot for the
They say Dad rushed to grab me
His pony tripped and fell
The caddle came in hundreds
Got mad and raised to hell

Two guns flew like lightning
Two steers dropped in a league
They were too close upon us
To check em in the speed

When the dust finally settled
The boys gathered around
They gathered up a body
That was trampeled in the ground

Their beneath the horse and cattle
Started by a faithful death
Who gave his life to save me
His little texas lad</pre>
