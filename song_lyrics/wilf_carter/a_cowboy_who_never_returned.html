A Cowboy Who Never Returned

<pre>Theres a cowboy who never returned boy
He lies just at the top of that knoll
His old faithful horse lies beside him
His saddle and old blanket rolled
If you listen I'll tell you my story
It happened on last sunday morn'

We were cutting some strays from the herd boy
He was called to that great land beyond
Old silver his pony was aging
His death was [????]
He sure did his best all with faith
We all knew his days soon were over
This day his work was too hard boy
He tripped when his foot hit a hole
He turned clean over and lay there
And beneith him poor charlie lay cold

When the sun said goodnight to the praire
We fulfilled our pals last request 
When he said let us both rest together
But be sure that we are both facing west
While we stood there with heads bowed in silence
My teardrops fell unashamed
I then realized how we'd miss him
Memories of our old pal still remain

Theres a cowboy who never returned boy
He'll join in our roundup no more
They say we'll all meet way up yonder
Where all cowboys troubles are over
And sometimes it sure makes me wonder
When at last it all comes to our turn
Will we meet once again like those old days
With the cowboy who never returned?</pre>
