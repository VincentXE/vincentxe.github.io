Wilf Carter - Hobo's Song of the Mounties

Oh listen to the song of the hobo
Riding on the east bound train
Amid the cenders flying from the old smoke stack
Oh listen to the sweet refrain 

We're just a jolly bunch of hobos
No money not a job can we find
So mr redcoat dont let us keep you waiting
we're just a going little farther down the line

Some folks say we have no worries
No taxes gas or coal bills to pay
We get our heat and gas from the old smoke stack 
as the old train is rattling on her way

Now we never stop to worry
The engineer is watching the line
All we gotta do is watch the mounty 
but we dont have much trouble gettin off in time

Oh his coat and buttons glisting in the sunshine 
and at his belt is hung a wicked gun
Just waiting there to catch a bunch of hobos 
because depession made us all go on the bum

They say its nice to make new acquaintances 
Many times we are presented to the judge
14 days in jail for riding on the rail 
and then we all get thrown in the junk

Do the police ever stop to consider
that we are helping them hold their job
if they didnt have the fun keeping us all on the run
they'd all be with us riding on the run

But now folks you've heard our story
The cops are heading down our way
They chase us going east, they chase us going west
Now I wonder where they think we are gonna stay 

We're just a jolly bunch of hobos
No money not a job we can find
So mr redcoat dont let us keep you waiting
we're just going a little farther down the line
