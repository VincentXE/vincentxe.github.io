Wilf Carter - Don't Forget Your Mother

As the sun was slowly setting on a summer day
Lying on a saddle blanket a dying cowboy lay
Comrade gather close around me
I'll soon be on my way
And to you i'll tell my story, listen what I say

Cowboy don't forget your mother, write a letter home
Though you've grown into manhood and you've chanced to roam
I know mother sad and lonely living all alone
On this earth I near can see her send my letter home

Tell her how I loved to see her though shes far away
But I'll meet her up in heaven on that judgement day
Tell her that i've still her picture and her lock of golden hair
I'll be waiting for you mother on that golden stair

Cowboy don't forget your mother, write a letter home
Though you've grown into manhood and you've chanced to roam
I know mother sad and lonely living all alone
On this earth I near will see her send my letter home

While a mellow moon was shining on the praire crest
In a grave just 6 by 3 we laid him down to rest
Many times we go a riding by his lonely grave
It brings back those haunting memories of when we heard him say

Cowboy don't forget your mother, write a letter home
Though you've grown into manhood and you've chanced to roam
I know mother sad and lonely living all alone
On this earth I near can see her send my letter home
