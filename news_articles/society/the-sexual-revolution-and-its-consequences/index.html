<h2>Sex | The sexual revolution and its consequences…</h2>
<h3>Author: Tom X Hart</h3>

<p>...have been a disaster for the human race.</p>

<p>A knock at the door announced his neighbour’s girlfriend – short, pert, and salted with paprika – at the threshold. She held in her hand a 3 litre bottle of White Ace, the tramp’s brew. This cheap booze, fortified cider, is a sort of Pepsi or Coca-Cola for tramps. It promises and delivers economical oblivion.</p>

<p>He came onto the doorstep and stood with her a moment. There on the porch, hidden slightly away, was the older woman who lived in a bedsit complex over the road. It was her bottle, of course. What business do short and pert young ladies have with White Ace? None at all.</p>

<p>The older woman was too weak to open her bottle, and so she turned to the younger woman for help. And she turned to him. He thought about the ethics, although only briefly. Should he open an alcoholic’s bottle? The answer: Yes, of course, because what good does it do to humiliate someone in addition to their already pathetic state? He was no-one’s parent and master, and so he could only grant – so far as it was possible – a little dignity to them.</p>

<p>The bottle opened with a hiss like a soporific snake.</p>

<p>She returned to her room to drink herself to death.</p>

<p>There are many like her warehoused in London bedsits. These, the remains of the sexual revolution, whose hedonism and divorces and abortions and drugs laid them at last alone and drunk. There is no point in moral condemnation, for their agency is limited and they did not understand what had caught them. And, in fact, we are all still living this revolution whether we care for it or not. We are still treading their path. We are digging our graves as they dug theirs. And we are not mourning the children that were never born.</p>

<p>The revolution, as with all revolutions, was promoted from above as a very good thing indeed. And, just as the Chinese still refuse to talk about the Cultural Revolution, we refuse to talk about our sexual revolution. The critical articles are never written. This is not due to censorship, but because the writers find it too painful to excavate this mistake – or admit their own culpability.</p>

<p>Men can handle the loneliness better. It is the women who really go to pieces, with looks gone and no grandchildren to spoil they quickly neglect themselves. They live a few pension or dole payments from eviction. A payment away from evisceration by the city’s concrete plateaus.</p>
